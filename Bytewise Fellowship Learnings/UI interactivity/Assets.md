# Updating the App Icon

- In your Flutter projectâ€™s root directory, navigate to .../`android/app/src/main/res` 
- The various bitmap resource folders such as mipmap-hdpi already contain placeholder images named ic_launcher.png. Replace them with your desired assets respecting the recommended icon size per screen density.

- for this use [AppIcon.co](https://appicon.co/) for getting the desired folders



# Updating the Splash Screen

- install `flutter_native_splash` from flutter pub
- make `flutter_native_splash.yaml` file as directed by the the documentation
- use image property to be the logo that will appear in the center
- use background-image or color property for background
