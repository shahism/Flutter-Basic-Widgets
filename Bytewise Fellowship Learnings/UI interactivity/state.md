# Managing state
***
## Widget Managing its own State:
`Single Stateful Widget`
***
## Parent Managing the state of Child:
`Parent will be stateful and it would manage the reusable child Stateless widgets`
***
## A mix-and-match approach 
`For some widgets, a mix-and-match approach makes the most sense. In this scenario, the stateful widget manages some of the state, and the parent widget manages other aspects of the state`
